# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a retro-style snake that grows in length as it eats the food scattered across the game area. The objective is to navigate the snake to consume as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.
